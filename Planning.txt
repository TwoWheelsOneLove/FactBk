How are we going to code?
Database people will code at the same time - in the same room 

At the start, everyone should be able to code a fair bit on their own
Then we’ll move on to features that depend on each other - which we’ll meet up to code
Towards the end we will all be in the same room to integrate all features of the program


How are we going to merge our code?
Shouldn't be a massive issue if we are in the same room - Can discuss it there and then
